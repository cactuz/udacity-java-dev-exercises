###Pre-requisites
1) Open the UploadController and change the targetPath, use absolute path.  In my experience on 
mac, using relative path with ~ did not work. 
2) Update the application.properties if you have a file larger than 300KB.

###Pre-requisites
On you browser, open localhost:8080 which should open an html to select and upload.
